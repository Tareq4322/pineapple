# Pineapple
This app is no longer being developed due to new Reddit API pricing. If you would like to use it, please create your own API key and build the app using instructions below ðŸ‘‡

UPDATE (4/17/25): A new version is in the works, which will further implement the features of the app and be released eventually as a working APK 

Reddit client for Android highlighting Material Design 3 aspects, with dynamic color and a clean, more minimalistic design. (WIP)

# Build notes
Before building, you must do the following steps so that OAuth and basic network functionality will work:
1. Sign-in, and create a new client on https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Make sure the redirect URI is set to "pineapple://login"
3. Copy the client secret, and paste in the ```gradle.properties``` file:
```
...

ClientSecret="PASTE CLIENT SECRET HERE"

...
```
4. Build in Android Studio or using gradle on the command line
